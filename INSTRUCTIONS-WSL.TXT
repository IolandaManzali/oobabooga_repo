Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui.

# Installation

Run the "start" script. By default it will install the web UI in WSL:
/home/{username}/text-gen-install

To launch the web UI in the future after it is already installed, run
the same "start" script. Ensure that webui.py and wsl.sh are next to it!

# Updating the web UI

Run the "update" script. This will only install the updates, so it should
be much faster than the initial installation.

# Adding flags like --chat, --notebook, etc

Edit the "webui.py" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the CMD_FLAGS variable at the top. It should look like this:

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat'

For instance, to add the --api flag, change it to

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat --api'

The "start" and "update" scripts will copy the edited "webui.py" to WSL
to be used by the web UI.

# Running an interactive shell

To run an interactive shell in the miniconda environment, run the "cmd"
script. This is useful for installing additional requirements manually.

# Changing the default install location

To change this, you will need to edit the scripts as follows:
wsl.sh: line ~19   INSTALL_DIR="/path/to/install/dir"
cmd_wsl.bat: line 7   call wsl -- cd /path/to/install; cd ./dir; ...

Keep in mind that there is a long-standing bug in WSL that significantly
slows drive read/write speeds when using a physical drive as opposed to
the virtual one that Linux is installed in.
