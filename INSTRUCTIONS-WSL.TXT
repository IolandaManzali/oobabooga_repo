# WSL setup

If you do not have WSL installed, see here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

If you want to install Linux to a drive other than C
Open powershell and enter these commands:

cd D:\Path\To\Linux
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <LinuxDistroURL> -OutFile Linux.appx -UseBasicParsing
mv Linux.appx Linux.zip

Then open Linux.zip and you should see several .appx files inside.
The one with _x64.appx contains the exe installer that you need.
Extract the contents of that _x64.appx file and run <distro>.exe to install.

******************************************************************************
*ENSURE THAT THE WSL LINUX DISTRO THAT YOU WISH TO USE IS SET AS THE DEFAULT!*
******************************************************************************

Do this by using these commands:
wsl -l
wsl -s <DistroName>

# Web UI Installation

Run the "start" script. By default it will install the web UI in WSL:
/home/{username}/text-gen-install

To launch the web UI in the future after it is already installed, run
the same "start" script. Ensure that webui.py and wsl.sh are next to it!

# Updating the web UI

Run the "update" script. This will only install the updates, so it should
be much faster than the initial installation.

You can also run "wsl.sh update" in WSL.

# Adding flags like --chat, --notebook, etc

Edit the "webui.py" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the CMD_FLAGS variable at the top. It should look like this:

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat'

For instance, to add the --api flag, change it to

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat --api'

The "start" and "update" scripts will copy the edited "webui.py" to WSL
to be used by the web UI.

# Running an interactive shell

To run an interactive shell in the miniconda environment, run the "cmd"
script. This is useful for installing additional requirements manually.

You can also run "wsl.sh cmd" in WSL.

# Changing the default install location

To change this, you will need to edit the scripts as follows:
wsl.sh: line ~22   INSTALL_DIR="/path/to/install/dir"

Keep in mind that there is a long-standing bug in WSL that significantly
slows drive read/write speeds when using a physical drive as opposed to
the virtual one that Linux is installed in.
